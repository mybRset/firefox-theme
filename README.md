## Tut
Put **all** of the components into a safe folder that you will not delete!
In the script: change the directory to the right images for the ui
  _Lines 120, 134, 137, 143_ (or you can just ask ChatGPT for a tutorial, im noot that good of a coder to make it automatic)
Also chage _my name_ to _your name_.

When this is done: go in _firefox settings_ -> _home_ -> set _Homepage and new windows_ to _custom URL_ and put the directory where you downloaded this config
